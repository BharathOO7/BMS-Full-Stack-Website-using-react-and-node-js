# ⚡ Full Stack Web App – React + Vite + ESLint

A modern, high-performance web application scaffold built with **React** and **Vite**, featuring hot module replacement (HMR), extensible ESLint rules, and a modular foundation ideal for production-ready projects.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🚀 **Vite** for lightning-fast dev server and optimized builds
- ⚛️ **React** for rich UI components
- 🔁 **Fast Refresh** enabled with both `@vitejs/plugin-react` (Babel) and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` (SWC)
- 💡 Clean ESLint config to catch issues early
- 🧱 Scalable structure for easy expansion into full-stack apps (Flask backend, REST APIs, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5173` with hot-reloading enabled.

---

## 🧩 Plugins

This template supports:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Uses **Babel** with React Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: Uses **SWC** for faster compile times

To switch between them, modify your `vite.config.js` accordingly.

---

## ✨ Linting & Code Quality

This starter includes a basic ESLint configuration using:

- `eslint`
- `eslint-plugin-react`
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`

To enhance your production app:
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Integrate `typescript-eslint` for full type-aware rules
- Extend ESLint with Prettier or Airbnb configs

```bash
npm install -D typescript @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
```

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

Vite builds are optimized for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy using Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting provider.

## 🔥 Future Stack Extensions

- 🧠 Integrate Flask REST backend with your React frontend
- 🎯 Add routing with `react-router-dom`
- 🛡️ Secure APIs with JWT tokens or OAuth
- 📦 Use Redux Toolkit or Zustand for state management
- 🌐 Add i18n for localization
